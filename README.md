A simulation framework for modular robots, designed to accelerate research in robot learning and evolutionary robotics.

**🚧 This is an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) under active development. More features and modular robot architectures will be added continuously.**

## Overview

MetaMachine is a simulation framework for modular robotic systems. Currently featuring a **MuJoCo-based modular legs** implementation based on [Agile Legged Locomotion in Reconfigurable Modular Robots](https://modularlegs.github.io/), this framework will expand to support diverse modular robot architectures using various simulation backends throughout my PhD research.

**Vision**: MetaMachine aims to become a cornerstone in the next-generation ecosystem for fast prototyping robot learning research systems, serving as both a robot learning and evolutionary robotics benchmark and comprehensive development platform.

## Current Implementation

### Modular Legs System
Based on "[Agile Legged Locomotion in Reconfigurable Modular Robots](https://modularlegs.github.io/)":
- **Autonomous modular legs**: Single-degree-of-freedom jointed links that learn complex dynamic behaviors
- **Reconfigurable metamachines**: Freely attachable modules forming meter-scale legged robots
- **Dynamic locomotion**: Non-quasistatic movement through unstructured environments

## Quick Start

### Installation

#### From PyPI (Recommended)

```bash
# Install the latest stable release
pip install metamachine

# Or install with optional dependencies
pip install metamachine[dev]   # Development tools
pip install metamachine[docs]  # Documentation tools
pip install metamachine[jax]   # JAX acceleration for pose optimization
```

#### From Source (Development)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/chenaah/metamachine
cd metamachine

# Install in development mode
pip install -e .

# Or install with development dependencies
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

#### System Requirements

- **Python**: 3.9 or higher
- **Operating System**: Linux, macOS, or Windows
- **Dependencies**: NumPy, Gymnasium, MuJoCo, OmegaConf

#### Verify Installation

```bash
python -c "import metamachine; print('MetaMachine installed successfully!')"
```

#### Troubleshooting

**MuJoCo Installation Issues:**
```bash
# On Linux, you may need additional system dependencies
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libgl1-mesa-glx libglib2.0-0 libsm6 libxext6 libxrender-dev libgomp1

# On macOS with Apple Silicon
pip install mujoco --no-binary mujoco
```

**Import Errors:**
```bash
# Ensure you have the latest pip
pip install --upgrade pip

# Clean install if you encounter issues
pip uninstall metamachine
pip install metamachine
```

### Basic Usage

```python
import numpy as np
from metamachine.environments.configs.config_registry import ConfigRegistry
from metamachine.environments.env_sim import MetaMachine

# Create modular legs environment
cfg = ConfigRegistry.create_from_name("basic_quadruped")
env = MetaMachine(cfg)

# Run simulation
env.reset(seed=42)
for step in range(1000):
    action = np.random.randn(env.action_space.shape[0])
    obs, reward, done, truncated, info = env.step(action)

    if done or truncated:
        break
```

## Development Roadmap

MetaMachine is actively being developed with plans to expand beyond modular legs:

- **Current**: Modular legs implementation (based on paper Agile legged locomotion in reconfigurable modular robots)
- **Upcoming**: Additional modular robot architectures during PhD research
- **Long-term**: Comprehensive benchmark suite for robot learning and evolutionary robotics
- **Vision**: Core component of next-gen robot learning research ecosystem
